# Open Source IoT Hand Hygiene Innovation

This project is in active development, updates can be expected to the code and the tutorial guide.

## Project History
This projects started at the Emily Carr University of Art + Design (ECUAD) as an initiative to bring interaction design to hand hygiene through an open-source solution, with an implementation at Vancouver General Hospital. Through time the project has evolved, and W21C has since taken the lead in the project. In 2017 the project was implemented in a unit at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and in 2019 the current version of hardware was implemented in Alberta Childrenâ€™s Hospital. 

## W21C
W21C is a research and innovation initiative based in the University of Calgary (UCalgary) and the Calgary Zone of Alberta Health Services (AHS). W21C conducts health systems research with the overarching mandate to improve patient safety and quality of care. Through this strategic research and innovation agenda, we hope to make care better for our communities, both now and in the future.
